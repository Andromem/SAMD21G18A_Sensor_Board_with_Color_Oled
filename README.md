This Sensor Board is yet another variation of the other one on my site. It is not for sale with no real purpose in mind. It was created as design challenge. My full time job is pcb design work and as a hobby I enjoy experimenting with new design ideas. This was one of the more challenging designs I've worked on in a while. A few times I'd given up on routing it. Evan using four routing layers I found it tough. The idea was to hide the bezel of the display behind the board but have sensor components on that same board. It would look something like a little tiny television with all the components around the edges. This latest revision has fixed a few issues I found on previous versions but the design idea can possibly help others in some way. Full credit goes to Adafruit for publishing the Feather M0 design files along with the bootloader. I used the Feather design to create the schematic for my board. Credit also goes to Microwavemont on Tindie and the SSD1331 library that he has  on his site compiles error free using the Arduino IDE.
